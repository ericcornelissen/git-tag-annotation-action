## Reporting a Vulnerability

The maintainers of the Git Tag Annotation Action take security bugs very
seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. Due
to the non-funded open-source nature of this project, we take a best-efforts
approach when it comes to engaging with (security) reports.

To report a security issue in a supported version of the Git Tag Annotation
Action, send an email to [security@ericcornelissen.dev] and include the words
_"SECURITY"_ and _"git-tag-annotation-action_ in the subject line. Please do not
open a regular issue or Pull Request in the public repository.

If you found a security bug in an unsupported version of the Git Tag Annotation
Action, please report this publicly. For example as a regular issue in the
public repository.
